# Encourage-Bot
My first try to develop bots

I followed this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&t=158s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

# INFO
- I used Discord.py to manipulate the discord api
- search for discord for developers to create and manage bots
- I used ZenQuotes api to retrieve quotes for the inpire command
- I created a web server using flask to keep the bot alive
- I used (UptimeRobot) to ping replit every 5 mins to keep the server alive

# Upcoming features 
- adding a help command
- adding play music command
- adding interactive snow replies 
- adding roll a dice command
- adding flip a coin game

# Useful technologies
- javacord / discord4j is equivelant to discord.py librariy in java
- javacord has great docs
